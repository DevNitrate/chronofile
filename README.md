# Description
Chronofile is a simple fast file searcher (searches whole disk in around 20s) built in rust (blazingly fast !!)

# Installation
First install ``chronofile.exe`` from [releases](https://github.com/DevNitrate/chronofile/releases/tag/release) and from here there are two options:
**1:**
  -put the file into your system32 and it's done. simply open the command prompt and you're ready to go.
**2:**
  -put the file where you want and then create an evironment variable linked to the folder where the file is stored. simply use it again
